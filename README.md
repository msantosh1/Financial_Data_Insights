# Conclusion
We can gain a lot of insights from the maket data, like which product sells best, which country genarates more income, etc.. I had included a type of visualization called "GUAGE" for total sales, which shows the current sales, sales income for next year and fictituous overall sales target for the company . I had included filters, wherein we can drill through a particular country or product or segment and gain an indepth insisghts/analysis for that particular category.
